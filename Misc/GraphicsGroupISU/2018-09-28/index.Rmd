# Why `bookdown`? 

In the author's [own words](https://slides.yihui.name/2017-rmarkdown-UNL-Yihui-Xie.html#4), books should be:

- easy to write
- cheap 
- dynamic
- quickly edited & re-released
- authored by a few people, edited/reviewed/contributed to by many

# What does `bookdown` assume about you? 

![](https://media.giphy.com/media/l1J9yApnGts8EXYoo/giphy.gif)

---
# R/RStudio

`bookdown` assumes you know how to use R, including

- how to install packages 
- how to put code chunks in a .Rmd file
- how to render plots from R code in a .Rmd file

Working knowledge of / a desire to use RStudio is not necessary but is exceedingly helpful.

If you're seeing this, I assume you have this minimal working knowledge of R/RStudio. 

---
# Markdown

`bookdown` assumes you are comfortable writing in Markdown, including

- headers
- tables
- font formatting (*italics*, **bold**, etc.)

Luckily, this is not hard to learn. See the [R Markdown Reference Guide](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/rmarkdown-reference.pdf) or the [cheat sheet](https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/raw/master/rmarkdown-2.0.pdf)

---
# `bibtex`

`bookdown` assumes you know how to work with .bib files, including: 

- You know what bibliography style you want 
- You understand inline citations
- You understand the structure of entries in a .bib file

See this [user guide](https://www.economics.utoronto.ca/osborne/latex/BIBTEX.HTM) and this [fill-in-the-blank](https://truben.no/latex/bibtex/) Bibtex editor

---
# LaTeX Math 

`bookdown` assumes you know how to write math things (equations, formulae, etc.) with LaTeX

![This is your brain on LaTeX](https://media.giphy.com/media/a9uGhT7WoO0p2/giphy.gif)

Here's the [Wikibook](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Mathematics) for LaTeX. Good luck.

If you're seeing this, I assume you're familiar with the not-so-gentle giant that is LaTeX

# Tricky Bits 

![How you doin'?](https://media.giphy.com/media/3oriNNm0VCA73UhVbq/giphy.gif)

---
# Math mode

For `displaymath`, sometimes you need to enter mathmode (via `$$`...`$$` or `\(`...`\)`), and sometimes you don't...

- If the math expression creates something in `displaymath` (e.g. `equation`, `eqnarray`, `align`), don't put it in math mode 
- Otherwise, it needs mathmode (e.g. `matrix`,  `array`, etc.)

.pull-left[
Need math mode: 

    $$a^2 + b^2 = c^2$$
    
$$a^2 + b^2 = c^2$$     
]
.pull-right[
Don't need math mode: 

    \begin{equation}
     a^2 + b^2 = c^2
     \end{equation}
\begin{equation}
a^2 + b^2 = c^2
\end{equation} 

]

# Inserting images

Can do `![caption](path)` like in usual .Rmd things, but (AFAIK):

- Figure numbering is hard (or impossible)
- "" referencing ""
- "" alignment ""


Instead, do `knitr::include_graphics()` inside an R code chunk. 

Why?

--

- Figure naming, referencing, and numbering included "for free" (`fig:chunkname`)
- Can control size, alginment, etc. very easily 

---
# Inserting images

.pull-left[
    ````
    ```{r, eval = FALSE}
    knitr::include_graphics("otrii.png")
    ```
    ````
with code chunk options:
`{r bey, fig.height=2,fig.align='center', fig.cap = "Beyonce", echo=FALSE}`
]

.pull-right[
```{r bey, fig.height=2,fig.align='center', fig.cap = "Beyonce", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("otrii.png")
```
]

---
# Inserting tables 

Again, can do it in the [usual markdown way](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet#tables), but (AFAIK):

- Table numbering is hard (or impossible)
- "" captions ""
- "" referencing ""
- "" alignment ""

Instead, do `knitr::kable()` inside an R code chunk. 

Why?

--

- Table naming, referencing, and numbering included "for free" (`tab:chunkname`)
- `caption` is an argument in the function 
- Get all the other "good stuff" from LaTeX/`xtable`. e.g. `digits`, `longtable`, etc. 

---
# Inserting tables

    ```{r, eval = FALSE}
    knitr::kable(head(mtcars), caption="mtcars data")
    ```
With chunk options `{results='asis'}` gives:   

```{r table2, results='asis', echo=FALSE}
knitr::kable(head(mtcars), caption="mtcars data", format = 'html')
```

# LaTeX v. `bookdown`

# References & Citations

Difference between using LaTeX (left) and using `bookdown` (right) for references:

.pull-left[
- Label sections with `\label{section-label}` after `\section{Section name}`. Refer to them with `\ref{section` `-label}`.

- Inline citations with `\citet{biblabel}`, `\citep{biblabel}`

- Figure/table references with `\ref{fig-` `or-tab-label}`

- Label equations with `\label{eqnname}` after `begin{equation}`. Refer to them with `\ref{eqn` `name}`.
]

.pull-right[
- Label sections with `{#section-label}` after `## Section name`. Refer to them with `\@ref(label)`

- Inline citations with `@biblabel`, `[@biblabel]`

- Figure/table references with `\@ref(fig:figlabel)` / `\@ref(tab:tablabel)`. `figlabel` and `tablabel` should be the code chunk names 

- Label equations with `(\#eq:eqnname)` the line above `\end{equation}`. Refer to them with `\@ref(eq:eqnname)`
]

---
# Theorems, Proofs, etc. 

Difference between using LaTeX (left) and using `bookdown` (right) for different [text environments](https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/markdown-extensions-by-bookdown.html#theorems):

.pull-left[

- Use `\begin{}` `\end{}` for `theorem`, `proof`, `definition`, etc. 

- Label and reference them with `\label{` `thmname}` and `\ref{` `thmname}`

]

.pull-right[
- Use "code chunks" : 
    ````
    ```'{theorem, 
    name="theorem name", label="lab"}
    ```
    ````

- Label them with `label="lab"` and reference them with `\@ref(prefix:label)` where `prefix` is one of `thm`, `lem`, [etc.](https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/markdown-extensions-by-bookdown.html#theorems)
]

---
# Customization

.pull-left[
In LaTeX, create custom formats with: 

- `\newcommand{` `}` 
- `\renewcommand{` `}` 
- `\newenvironment{` `}` 

]

.pull-right[
In `bookdown`, create [custom formats](https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/custom-blocks.html) with: 

- `{block}` environment + custom [CSS](https://github.com/rstudio/bookdown/blob/master/inst/examples/css/style.css) styles 
- Similar to the way `{theorem}` works

# Other random fun `bookdown` facts

...that I discovered while writing these slides

1. Part and Appendix [headers](https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/markdown-extensions-by-bookdown.html#special-headers) for separating different groups of chapters 
2. Text [references](https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/markdown-extensions-by-bookdown.html#text-references) to save your sanity when writing figure/table captions
3. You can [embed whole webpages](https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/web-pages-and-shiny-apps.html) in online books written with `bookdown`. (i.e. for `shiny` apps)

# Congrats! 

You've just taken a very important step in writing your thesis! 

![](https://media.giphy.com/media/l0Iy6RfxFjVqP8NQQ/giphy.gif)

# Full disclosure

I did NOT write my thesis in bookdown. 

I had a lot of stuff in .Rnw files already, and was not willing/able to convert everything over to .Rmd at the time when `bookdown` was picking up speed. 

So, if you want to use bookdown (and I think you should), just know that I'm not the *best* source for troubleshooting.

# Important points

- File structure: getting and keeping files organized is just about as important as doing the actual work. If you can't find it, did you even do it? 
    - Think about some other folders you might need: data, code, images, raw-data, etc. 

- Anything with "isu" in the filename came directly from the grad college. Don't edit these files (unless you REALLY know what you're doing).

- There's also no need to change anything in _config.yml (again, unless you REALLY know what you're doing.)

- Trial and error. When something doesn't work, just keep trying different things and doing new google searches.

# Getting started 

Open index.Rmd. 

1. Fill in your name
2. Fill in your major professor (if applicable)
3. Fill in your committee (if applicable)
4. Create a cool-sounding, impermanent title. 
5. In the "Build" tab in RStudio, click "Build Book." 

---
# Keep going

Play around for a little bit. I'll go around and answer questions. Some things you could try: 

- Create a new chapter (see _bookdown.yml for a hint of how to do this)
- Insert R code & a plot
- Insert an image
- Write the dedication (preface/dedication.tex)

---
# Conclusion

- If you want to do a book/thesis in bookdown, it's worth sitting down and reading the bookdown book. 
- Covers stuff you probably didn't even think of (very true for me)

- If you want bookdown's author to answer your questions, formatting them in the [optimal way](https://yihui.name/en/2018/05/github-issue-format/) will help your cause.
